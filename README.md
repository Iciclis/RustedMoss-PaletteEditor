Palette Editor v0.1: get that look you've ever wanted without exiting the game
- **Installation**: install `rmml`, unzip `palette_editor` into `Mose/mods/rmml` and add `palette_editor` to `modlist.txt`
- If you want to use your existing palette and hair options you should rename them to `palette_fern.png` and `hair_data.ini` respectively
- Open the editor window at any save statue with `P` hotkey
- You can copy and paste the `hex` of a currently selected color with `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+v` 
- The palette saves automatically when you close the editor or leave a room
- Now supports Maya and Ameli! For that you should install Maya and/or Ameli palette mods along with this mod
- If you don't like an extra tooltip at the save statue or editor window moving when you go near it, you can turn it off in the `palette_editor.md` file
- If you use any other mod that modifies the player you should turn off player replacement in the `palette_editor.md` file
- If you're upgrading from earlier version open `%localappdata%\Rusted_Moss\Fern_custom` and copy your `palette.png` and `hair_data.ini` to the `Fern_custom` that is in the game install folder and then delete `Fern_custom` from local appdata

**WARNING! RMML is required for this mod!**
